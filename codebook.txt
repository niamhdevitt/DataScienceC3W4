#Getting and Cleaning Data Course 3 Week 4

##Codebook for Tidy dataset

Tidy data contains 180 rows and 82 columns. Each row has averaged variables for each subjectID and each activityID.

Only variables estimated from mean and standard deviation in the tidy set are kept. 
The data was averaged based on each subject and activity group.

Activity column has 6 types as listed below.

1. WALKING
2. WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3. WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4. SITTING
5. STANDING
6. LAYING

Each subject column is indexed sequentially from 1 to 30.

The tidy data contains 1 row for each subjectID and activityID grouping, with the following variable names.
